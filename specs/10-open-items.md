# PART X — RESIDUAL OPEN ITEMS (safe to settle during build)

- Exact single-tick op order when many events coincide (R3 gives the frame; edge sequencing
  finalizes in code).
- Frogleap trigger details for unbreakable non-budgeted types (rare).
- ~~Whether the missing-data ceremony fully merges with the >30-min-gap modal in UI (assumed
  yes).~~ **RESOLVED (Stage 3/4):** yes — one `GapFillModal` with two entry points (history
  editor gap rows; the SOD missing-data precondition, §4.2).
- **RESOLVED (Stage 4):** `DayRecord` shape is minimal `{ id, start, end, reportDate }` (aggregates
  derived, not cached); SOD sleep-count scoping is 0/1 → GapFill, 2 → sweep, 3+ → sweep first two;
  pruning discards auto-dead ∪ user-chosen (per-item + Discard-all/Carry-all). See §4.2.
- Default pomodoro preset shipped.
- ~~Injected-leftover relative priority default (assumed: injected ranks below leftovers).~~
  **RESOLVED (Stage 5):** injected weekly tasks rank strictly below surviving leftovers (§4.4);
  user drags to re-rank. Recurrence is a weekday set (one-time/ranged: deferral lifted 2026-07-16 —
  template validity, see §4.4); mid-week planning
  is locked (open on OFF days / pre-week / urgent); off-periods book to a new built-in Off-Periods
  head. See §4.4/§4.5.
